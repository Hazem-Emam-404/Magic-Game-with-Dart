# Magic Math Game ðŸŽ®âœ¨

A fun Dart CLI game that guesses your chosen number (between 1 and 30) using binary magic!

## How It Works
1. **Pick a number** between 1 and 30 (but don't tell the program!).
2. The program shows you 5 boxes of numbers.
3. For each box, answer **Y/N** if your number is in it.
4. The program **magically reveals** your number at the end!

*(Hint: It's based on binary addition of the first numbers in each box you say "Y" to!)*
